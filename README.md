<h1>Learning how to use API's</h1>
This project was not that difficult, realistically all that needed to be done was to receive the data from the API endpoint, convert the data into a medium that fits the applications usecase, and stylistically represent that data on the webpage.

I still need to do a lot of work on the styling part of my skillset, the design of this website lends itself no praise.
